testing:

1. lighter [v]
2. darker [v]
3. shutting off/turning on [v]


issues:
[v, by syncing write, delete better] 0. Getting random exceptions from hummus jpg [now that i stopped deleting the images...see if this still happens]

1. include a retry policy, on state request (especially), on changing lights etc...
2. i'm getting sometimes waits...figure out why...if ok and expected (lost sudden contact with light), cool. if not...resolve
3. make sure i don't get going up/down automatically due to high resolution
4. make sure runs properly when other bulbs exist
5. remove need for timeout when checking if lights off is good (right now have to turn off so picture is not taken too soon)
6. theres a problem with images being deleted too early...
7. sometimes stuck in waiting for bulb to clear, need to retry? or fail after timeout?
8. worked between 12-6:20....and then died [and i don't even know why :(]

features
- [v] Continuous run [make sure to start counting only when done!]
- I need a good method to turn off the lights if somebody opened them by mistake [if that's at all important]
