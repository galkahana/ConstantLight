the application will provide an option to choose
	- bulb [if not chosen, will take the previous one defined].
	- desired level of brightness by either providing one, or taking the current one.

I want also to allow running either continously, adjusting the light every 2 mts, or stop immediately. so put it all in a nice function.

and so the inputs are:
	inputs:
		- bulb name
		- desired level of brightness


now do this:
	1. Open the thing, wait for right bulb to be detected. once done continue to 2 (callback)
	2. Adjust the light:
		2.1 Grab an image and determine brightness, then done go to 2.2 (callback)
		2.2 If image brightness higher than desired for the given threshold, go darker a small step [see "going darker"], 
				when ready and if not failed continue to 2.1 (callback). if failed go to 3
		2.3 If image brightness lower than desired for the given threshold, go brighter a small step [see "going brighter"], 
				when ready and if not failed continue to 2.1 (callback). if failed go to 3
		2.4 otherwise go to 3
	3. finish

[going darker]
	1. determine current value, when done go to (2)
	2. if off or low enough, return failure (can't go darker)
	3. otherwise go lower a step, where if low enough turn the light off, otherwise make sure it's on, when done call callback

[goind brighter]
	1. determine current value, when done go to (2)
	2. if in max value and on, return failure (can't go lighter)
	3. if was off, turn on, otherwise go higher a step. in any case, when done, call callback


	NEED BETTER STOPPING CONDITION!!!!! so that i'm not dependent on threshold and stepssss
